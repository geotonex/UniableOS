# Uniable<b>OS</b>
simple/productive/free linux distro

UniableOS is a fast, stable, welterweight, and easy-to-install Linux desktop distribution live CD based on Debian Stable for Intel-AMD amd64 compatible computer systems initiated by George Vasilache in 2022.

The vision and rationale behind this initiative is that, given the rapid pace of hardware and software development, as well as the increasing digital footprint and per-user cost of commercial solutions, old public sector infrastructures, schools, students, and healthcare systems are struggling to maintain their hardware and software infrastructures within tight budgets.


UniableOS can run on most computers, ranging from systems with 2048 MB RAM, dual-core processors, and 15 GB of disk space with pre-configured swap, to the latest powerful workstations and laptops. To install Uniable OS to a hard drive, you will need a minimum of 10 GB of hard disk space.

Here are some of the key features of Uniable OS:

    Fast and lightweight: Uniable OS is designed to be fast and lightweight, making it ideal for older computers.
    Easy to install: Uniable OS is easy to install, making it a great choice for users who are not familiar with Linux.
    MATE desktop environment: Uniable OS uses the MATE desktop environment, which is a user-friendly and customizable environment.
    Wide range of compatibility: Uniable OS can run on most computers, making it a versatile choice for users with a variety of hardware.
    Uniable OS uses Flatpak, a universal package format that allows you to distribute, install, and manage software without worrying about dependencies or runtime. Flatpak is developed and maintained by an independent, open-source community, so it is not tied to any single vendor. This makes it a versatile and flexible package format that can be used on a wide range of Linux distributions.

If you are looking for a fast, privacy-enhanced, ergonomic, and cloud-ready Linux operating system that is easy to install and use, Uniable OS is a good option. It is suitable for most computers built in the last 10 years and offers a user-friendly desktop experience.
